To run this project in a Distrobox based on the `ppw` image described in the Dockerfile, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Project Repository:**
   If you haven't already cloned the project repository into your local machine, do so now. Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your project's repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ascotai/ppwdump.git
   cd ppwdump
   ```

2. **Install Distrobox:**
   If you haven't already installed Distrobox, you can do so by following the instructions on their GitHub page: [Distrobox Installation](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox#installation).

3. **Build a Local Container Image from the Dockerfile:**
   Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `Docker/Dockerfile`. Build a local container image named `ppw` using either Podman or Docker, depending on which you have installed.

   ```bash
   # Using Docker
   docker build -t ppw .

   # Using Podman
   podman build -t ppw .
   ```

4. **Create a Distrobox Container Using the Local Image:**
   Once the container image is built, you can create a new Distrobox container based on this local image. You can name the container as per your preference, for example, `ppw-container`.

   ```bash
   distrobox-create -n ppw-container -i ppw
   ```

5. **Enter the Distrobox Container:**
   Once the container is created, you can enter it using:

   ```bash
   distrobox-enter ppw-container
   ```

6. **Install Dependencies:**
   Inside the Distrobox container, install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using pip. Note that version 0.3.0 of `langchain-ollama` must be installed for compatibility with `browser-use`.

   ```bash
   # Uninstall the current version of langchain-ollama if it's installed
   pip uninstall langchain-ollama -y

   # Install the specific version required
   pip install langchain-ollama==0.3.0

   # Install other dependencies from requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. **Run the Project:**
   You can now run the project using the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m ppwdump
   ```

This will execute the main script located in `__main__.py`, which in turn calls the `main` function from `main.py`.
